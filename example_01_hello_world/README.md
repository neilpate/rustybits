# Example 01 - Hello World

A simple LED blinking example that blinks one LED on the micro:bit's LED matrix.

## What it does

This is the "Hello World" for embedded systems - it blinks an LED! The program:

1. Initializes the micro:bit board
2. Configures row 1 and column 1 of the LED matrix 
3. Continuously blinks the LED at the intersection (500ms on, 100ms off)

## Running this example

This example is completely self-contained - it includes all necessary configuration files:

### From Command Line
```bash
cd example_01_hello_world
cargo run
```

### From VS Code
1. Open `src/main.rs` in VS Code
2. Click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Run** button above the `#[entry]` function
3. Or use `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Tasks: Run Task" ‚Üí "Run Example 01"

> **üí° VS Code Tip**: When viewing the source code, you'll see a small ‚ñ∂Ô∏è "Run" arrow above the `#[entry]` function. This is provided by rust-analyzer and lets you run the example with a single click!

#### Debugging in VS Code

You can also debug this example directly on the micro:bit hardware. Start the session using the preconfigured launch command (or just press F5).

This command is set up to halt the CPU on load. You can resume as usual by pressing the run arrow at the top.

If you don't like this behaviour you can disable this automatic halting. Then use breakpoints as usual to pause execution.

### What Happens
- **Builds** the project for ARM Cortex-M4 (`thumbv7em-none-eabihf` target)
- **Flashes** the binary to your micro:bit via probe-rs
- **Runs** the program on the micro:bit hardware
- **LED blinks** at row 1, column 1 position

## Project Structure

This example contains everything needed to build and run independently:

```
example_01_hello_world/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .cargo/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.toml      # Build configuration (ARM target, probe-rs runner)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs          # Your Rust code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml           # Dependencies and project metadata
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.lock           # Locked dependency versions (for reproducible builds)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Embed.toml           # probe-rs flashing configuration
```
## Code Overview

```rust
#![no_main]
#![no_std]

use cortex_m_rt::entry;
use embedded_hal::{delay::DelayNs, digital::OutputPin};
use microbit::hal::{gpio, timer};
use panic_halt as _;

#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    let board = microbit::Board::take().unwrap();

    let mut row1 = board.display_pins.row1.into_push_pull_output(gpio::Level::High);
    let _col1 = board.display_pins.col1.into_push_pull_output(gpio::Level::Low);

    let mut timer0 = timer::Timer::new(board.TIMER0);

    loop {
        timer0.delay_ms(100);
        row1.set_high().unwrap();
        timer0.delay_ms(100);
        row1.set_low().unwrap();
    }
}
```

## How It Works

This example demonstrates the basics of micro:bit LED control:

1. **Board Initialization**: `microbit::Board::take().unwrap()` - Gets exclusive access to the micro:bit hardware
2. **LED Setup**: Configures row 1 and column 1 of the LED matrix - an LED lights when its row is HIGH and column is LOW
3. **Timer**: Uses the hardware timer for precise delays
4. **Blink Loop**: Toggles the LED every 100ms to create a blinking effect

### The micro:bit LED Matrix
The micro:bit's 5x5 LED display works as a matrix - each LED is controlled by setting its row HIGH and column LOW. This example controls just one LED at position (1,1).

- **`.cargo/config.toml`** - Build configuration (ARM target, probe-rs runner)  
- **`Cargo.toml`** - Dependencies and project metadata
